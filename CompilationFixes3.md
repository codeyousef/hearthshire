# Final Compilation Fixes (Round 3)

## Latest Fixes Applied

### 1. Const Method Call
- Fixed `UpdateStatistics()` call in const method `GetPerformanceReport()`
- Used `const_cast` to allow the call: `const_cast<FVoxelPerformanceMonitor*>(this)->UpdateStatistics()`

### 2. Missing STAT Definitions
- Added `#include "VoxelPerformanceStats.h"` to:
  - VoxelMeshGenerator.cpp
  - VoxelGreedyMesher.cpp
- This provides the STAT macro definitions needed by SCOPE_CYCLE_COUNTER

### 3. VoxelSize Access
- Moved `VoxelSize` constant to public section in UVoxelChunkComponent
- Was under protected section, now accessible from AVoxelChunk
