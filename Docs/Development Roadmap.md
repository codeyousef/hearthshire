## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks (Updated)

**Risk**: 25cm voxels overwhelming mobile GPU

- **Mitigation**: Aggressive LOD, smaller chunks
- **Fallback**: Dynamic voxel size based on platform

**Risk**: Blueprint performance with detailed voxels

- **Mitigation**: Greedy meshing, update distribution
- **Fallback**: Blueprint nativization for shipping

**Risk**: Memory usage with smaller voxels

- **Mitigation**: Streaming, compression, pooling
- **Fallback**: Reduce active chunk count
