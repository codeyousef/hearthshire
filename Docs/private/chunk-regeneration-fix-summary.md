# Chunk Regeneration Fix Summary

## Problem
When hitting Play in the editor, chunks that were manually generated (e.g., using "Generate Flat World") were being regenerated with procedural terrain, creating "weird upside down pyramid" structures.

## Root Cause
The `GetOrCreateChunk` function was always generating procedural terrain for chunks that didn't come from a template, even if they had been manually created in the editor.

## Solution
Implemented a system to track and preserve manually generated chunks:

### 1. Added `bHasBeenGenerated` flag to VoxelChunk
- Added in `VoxelChunk.h`: Protected member variable to track if chunk has been manually generated
- Added public methods: `HasBeenGenerated()` and `MarkAsGenerated()`
- Initialized to false in constructor

### 2. Modified chunk generation logic
- Updated `GetOrCreateChunk` in `VoxelWorld.cpp` to check `HasBeenGenerated()` before procedural generation
- Only generates procedural terrain if chunk is not from template AND hasn't been manually generated

### 3. Updated manual generation functions
- `GenerateFlatWorld` now calls `MarkAsGenerated()` after creating flat terrain
- `SetChunkData` (used by template loading) also marks chunks as generated

### 4. Added editor chunk preservation
- Added `bPreserveEditorChunks` property to VoxelWorld (defaults to true)
- In `BeginPlay`, existing chunks are marked as generated if preservation is enabled
- This prevents chunks created in editor from being regenerated when entering Play mode

## Testing
1. In editor, click "Generate Flat World" button
2. Hit Play - flat world should remain flat, not regenerate as hills or pyramids
3. Toggle "Preserve Editor Chunks" to false to allow regeneration if desired

## Files Modified
- `/Source/HearthshireVoxel/Public/VoxelChunk.h` - Added bHasBeenGenerated flag and methods
- `/Source/HearthshireVoxel/Private/VoxelChunk.cpp` - Initialize flag, mark as generated in SetChunkData
- `/Source/HearthshireVoxel/Public/VoxelWorld.h` - Added bPreserveEditorChunks property  
- `/Source/HearthshireVoxel/Private/VoxelWorld.cpp` - Check flag before procedural generation, preserve editor chunks
