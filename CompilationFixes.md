# Compilation Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Forward Declaration
- Changed `UVoxelWorld` to `AVoxelWorld` (correct actor class type)

### 2. Static Member Function
- Removed `const` from `UpdateStatistics()` method declaration
- Fixed `this` pointer usage in static context

### 3. STAT Macros
- Wrapped `SCOPE_CYCLE_COUNTER` macros with `#if VOXEL_ENABLE_STATS`
- Prevents undefined identifier errors when stats are disabled

### 4. Private Member Access
- Moved helper functions from private to public in `FVoxelMeshGenerator`:
  - `AddQuad()`
  - `GetFaceNormal()`
  - `GetFaceVertices()`
  - `GetFaceUVs()`
  - `IsFaceVisible()`

### 5. Duplicate Class Definition
- Removed duplicate `FVoxelGreedyMesher` class from VoxelMeshGenerator.h
- Keep only the one in VoxelGreedyMesher.h

### 6. VoxelSize Access
- Moved `VoxelSize` constant from private to public in `UVoxelChunkComponent`

### 7. GameThread Execution
- Changed `Async(EAsyncExecution::GameThread, ...)` to `AsyncTask(ENamedThreads::GameThread, ...)`
- Correct syntax for UE5 async execution

### 8. Struct Initialization
- Fixed `FVoxelLODConfig` initialization from brace initializer to proper member assignment
- UE5 structs with USTRUCT() don't support brace initialization

### 9. Protected Member Access
- Made `ActiveChunks` public with `BlueprintReadOnly` for Blueprint access
- Allows VoxelBlueprintLibrary to access the chunk map

### 10. Missing Include
- Added `#include "VoxelWorld.h"` to VoxelTestActor.h for `FVoxelWorldConfig`

### 11. Platform Detection
- Fixed `IsMobilePlatform()` call by using compile-time macro check
- `#if VOXEL_MOBILE_PLATFORM` instead of runtime function

## Next Steps

1. Generate project files
2. Build in Visual Studio
3. Fix any remaining compilation errors
4. Test the voxel system

The code should now compile successfully with these fixes applied.
